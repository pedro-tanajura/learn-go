# Instructions for setting up the 'gorun' alias

## Option 1: Add to your ~/.zshrc file

Open your ~/.zshrc file in a text editor:

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

Add the following line at the end of the file:

```bash
alias gorun="your-path-to/learn-go/gorun"
```

Save and close the file, then reload your zsh configuration:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Option 2: Create a symbolic link in a directory in your PATH

If you prefer, you can create a symbolic link in a directory that's already in your PATH:

```bash
ln -s your-path-to/learn-go/gorun /usr/local/bin/gorun
```

This will make the 'gorun' command available system-wide without needing to set up an alias.

## Usage

Once set up, you can run any program in the repository with:

```bash
gorun data-structures/stack
gorun hello
```

This is equivalent to running:

```bash
make run PROGRAM=data-structures/stack
make run PROGRAM=hello
```
